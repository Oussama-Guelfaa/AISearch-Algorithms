# AISearch-Algorithms

This project implements various search strategies in artificial intelligence to solve state-space search problems.

## Implemented Algorithms

- **Depth-First Search**: Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
- **Uniform Cost Search**: Explores nodes in order of increasing path cost.
- **Best First Search**: Uses a heuristic function to determine which nodes to explore first.
- **A* Search**: Combines the advantages of Uniform Cost Search and Best First Search.

## Solved Problems

- **Simple Graph Problem**: Finding a path in a directed graph.
- **Water Jug Problem**: Measuring exactly 2 liters of water using two jugs with capacities of 4 and 3 liters.
